# 🏥 Hospital OPD & Appointment Management System (HAMS)

The **Hospital OPD & Appointment Management System (HAMS)** is a role-based ASP.NET Core Web API that allows for efficient management of hospital outpatient appointments, patient registrations, doctor availability, and medical records. The system is built following a clean architecture pattern, with layered responsibilities such as Services, Repositories, and DTOs. It includes robust JWT-based authentication and role-based authorization.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [.NET SDK 7.0 or later](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/)
- [SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server)
- [Visual Studio 2022+](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)
- Postman or Swagger UI for testing

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vishwanimap25/Hospital-OPD-Appointment-Management-System-HAMS-.git
   cd Hospital-OPD-Appointment-Management-System-HAMS-
````

2. **Update `appsettings.json`**

   ```json
   "ConnectionStrings": {
     "DefaultConnection": "Server=YOUR_SERVER;Database=HospitalAppointmentManage;Trusted_Connection=True;"
   },
   "JwtSettings": {
     "Key": "your-secret-key",
     "Issuer": "your-issuer",
     "Audience": "your-audience",
     "DurationInMinutes": 60
   }
   ```

3. **Run EF Core Migrations**

   ```bash
   dotnet ef database update
   ```

4. **Run the API**

   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

5. Open Swagger at:

   ```
   https://localhost:<port>/swagger
   ```

## 🔐 Authentication

* Register/Login endpoints generate a **JWT token**
* Token must be provided in the `Authorization` header:

  ```
  Authorization: Bearer <your-jwt-token>
  ```

### Roles Supported

* `Admin`
* `Doctor`
* `Patient`

Each role has access to specific API endpoints.

## 🛠️ Key Concepts

* **AutoMapper**: Maps between Entities and DTOs
* **DTOs**: Prevent overposting and shape response objects
* **Repository Pattern**: Clean separation of data logic
* **Service Layer**: Handles business logic
* **Middleware**: Global exception handling for user-friendly error messages

---

## ✅ To-Do (Planned Enhancements)

* [ ] Medical history & prescription tracking
* [ ] Email notification for appointments
* [ ] Admin dashboard & analytics
* [ ] Unit tests and integration tests
* [ ] Pagination and filtering in GET endpoints
